    "question": "When and why would you apply 'Min-Max Scaling' to numerical features in a dataset?",
    "answer": "Min-Max Scaling is applied to transform numerical features into a specific range, typically [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. It's used when algorithms, like neural networks or K-Nearest Neighbors, are sensitive to the scale of input features, ensuring that no single feature dominates due to its larger magnitude. It's suitable when the data distribution is not highly skewed or does not contain significant outliers, as outliers can disproportionately compress the range of other data points.",

    "answer": "Directly assigning numerical labels introduces an artificial ordinal relationship (e.g., 2 > 1) which does not exist in the nominal 'City' feature. This can mislead models into assuming that London is 'greater' or more important than New York simply because its numerical value is higher. One-Hot Encoding addresses this by creating a new binary column for each unique category. For example, 'City_New York', 'City_London', etc. For a given data point, the column corresponding to its city will be 1, and others will be 0. This removes the artificial ordinality and represents each category independently.",
